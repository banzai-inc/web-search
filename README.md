# web-search

A Clojure library with a set of tools for searching the web (Google).

Right now, web-search does one thing: searches a Custom Search engine via Google. Follow instructions here to create your Custom Search engine: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview.

Then, if you want to search the entire web, follow this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6099663/alternative-to-the-deprecated-google-rest-web-search-api.
